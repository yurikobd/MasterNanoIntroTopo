# LESSONS_Master_Nano_IntroTopo

This repository contains some useful material for the class given in the Máster Universitario en Nanofísica y Materiales Avanzados. 
The files are:
- NOTES.pdf: contains the notes of the class
- SSH_Simul.ipynb: contains the code of the SSH model

Please download the file SSH_Simul.ipynb to access the Jupyter Notebook with the simulations shown in class. To run it you need to have Jupyter notebook installed in your computer with the necessary libraries (kwant, numpy,..etc). 
For the people who don't have Jupyter Notebook an online service is available upon invitation (in Cocal). Please write an email to yuribaba@ucm.es to access to the Cocal project)
